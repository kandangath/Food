# Curry Chicken

## Ingredients
- Chicken Thighs (preferably bone-in)
- 2 large red onions
- Ginger, Garlic
- Spice Mix (Freshly ground coriander, cumin, white pepper, black pepper, cinnamon stick)
- Bay leaves

## Method
1. Put pressure cooker on saute, and heat up some coconut oil.
2. Add bay leaves, and saute ginger and garlic.
3. Add the spice mix and saute without burning it.
4. Add the chicken thighs and mix it well in the spices.
5. Add the onions and saute for a few more minutes.
6. Add salt.
7. Close the lid, and set to pressure cook (medium pressure, 20 mins)
8. After it's cooked, add in dried coriander leaves.

## Bonus
- Add basil leave in the chicken before pressure cooking
- After chicken is cooked, there's probably excess water. Remove the chicken pieces, and set the cooker to reduce and thicken the gravy.
